## ADHD for the non ADHD

In January of 2024, I watched two youtube videos by [Tris of No Boilerplate](https://www.youtube.com/@NoBoilerplate)
([one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck9FMtIGVxQ) and [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUZ9VATeF_4))
on being highly productive with ADHD that kickstarted a period of intense self reflection. Without
spoiling much, the videos recount his experience of growing up and learning to be productive 
in a software centered role. Notably, Tris describes the creation of self-imposed rules that he calls
***coping mechanisms***. These videos laid out something about myself I had never put into words; 
an omnipresent struggle to fight my own attention span just to be functional. 

While that statement may feel familiar to many of my disposition, I think its worth 
trying to describe the experience via an imperfect analogy. Imagine yourself as a spider in a 
long dark tunnel. Your goal is to get out of the tunnel. Easy right? Just walk along 
the tunnel and eventually it will lead out!

<div style="text-align: center;">

Simple as can be!
</div>

Well... not so fast. You see, there sure are a lot of flies in this tunnel and you sure are hungry. 
You jump to catch one only to realize it has thrown you in a random direction. Another fly comes by...
another jump, another random direction.

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="/images/blogposts/feed_me/jumping_around.gif" alt="FeedMe CLI" class="code-screenshot">
Oh no! So hard to get out of the tunnel!
</div>

This won't do! There are just too many flies pulling you in random ways! You decide that you are better 
off building a web behind you to block off one direction! Congratulations. That is your first coping mechanism.
As you move through the tunnel you work to build webs behind you, all of which leads you in the 
direction of a single exit. No matter which direction you jump, you will never travel too far in the
wrong way!

<div style="text-align: center;">

So much easier to get out now!
</div>

I am trying to illustrate that ADHD is a somewhat uncontrollable random force. Building and enacting 
resistance in the form of coping mechanisms is hard work. Here is how I typically experience it:
1. I attempt to do a task and realize by trial and error that I am defficient at it.
1. I do a retrospection to find some way to make it easier. Usually a simple set of rules.
1. When I find something that works, I try bake it in to myself as a context triggered habit.

Like moving a spider web, there is a small cost every time a coping mechanism is triggered. Picture it 
like an extra calculations in your mind, adding overhead to all the thoughts you make. These costs tend
to build up and can lead to exhaustion over long days or in stimulating environments. I find shopping in 
particular can be quite tiring.

## The Web of Mechanisms

The problem of the spider in the tunnel is an example of what I call a ***structured problem***. 
It has clear rules and even [a completely random walk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion) 
is likely to succeed given enough time. Imagine if instead of a spider in a tunnel, you are a spider 
trying to get to the hole in a golf course. The structure provided by the walls of the tunel has been
lifted and your old coping mechanism does not even make sense anymore.

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="/images/blogposts/feed_me/golf.jpg" alt="FeedMe CLI" class="code-screenshot" style="transform: rotate(-90deg)">

</div>

This is the reality of coping mechanisms in the real world. No mechanism is an effective catch all
for the wide variety of media, goals, and tasks assigned to people. What works well
on paper won't work well on a computer with internet. What works well to focus you on programming 
won't help focus you on difficult in person conversations. I had to falter in every context over 
and over to understand that I was missing a coping mechanism. I had to invent that mechanism. I 
had add it to the list.

The net result is a huge web of little rules I hold myself accountable for. Imagine this like the spider
weaving a thread each time it jumps further away from the hole of the golf course. The web slowly fills in, 
and eventually it becomes clogged up in any direction other than the hole and the task becomes solvable again.

</div>

That is my favorite depiction of the ***web of mechanisms*** I have built myself. As time has gone on, I 
have added enough safety nets to tackle a lot of tasks as if I don't have ADHD at all. Despite my efforts 
*a lot* of task is not *all* tasks and things slip through. My web is still composed of threads with 
holes between them, and I can fall through unexpectedly at times.

## Splitting in Two

> Wait.. all this time?

After this random pair youtube videos, I realized for the first time the incredible tax
that ADHD has had on me over the years. I saw how many times that I blamed myself for personnal 
failures that I couldn't explain. It was heartbreaking to remember all the times I thought I was a bad 
person, when I just hadn't built the right coping mechanism yet.

> If I got this far with this burden, how much farther could I go without it?

Next came a feeling of untapped potential and the desire to look for medication. I felt angry
that I had to work harder things others got for free. I sought professional help but struggled 
with the process, needing friends to help me navigate it. Finally, I managed to get some medication
in a sketchy alley in Chinatown. I got my first taste of focus.

> Is this really me?

For the first time in my life, it felt like the act of moving my focus was more energy intensive
than keeping it in place. I realized what I had been missing, but noticed something was lost
along the way. That intricate web of coping mechanisms that constantly bounced me around my mind had become 
so rooted into my ego that I could not cleanly separate myself from it. My identity was 
drawn into question as I wondered if all these silly rules were a tool or a part of me.

> I can't book my own doctors appointments.

My internal conflict was drawn to a crescendo when I booked my own doctors appointment while medicated.
This may seem mundane, but I would sort booking a doctors appointment as an ***unstructured problem***. 
The tasks to complete it are obscure, the rules are intricate, the process is unenjoyable, the deadline is nebulous 
and the priority is lower than more immediate tasks. This makes it incredibly difficult to build 
coping mechanisms around it. It's like the spider casting threads only to find there is no wall for 
them to cling to. It was difficult to be so far from myself and yet be more capable.

> Which version of myself do I choose?

I can only describe the next feelings as despair. On one side, I was not myself, and on the other I was
unable to solve a crucially important subset of tasks. I was at an impass, and I reached out to many for
help. Over time they convinced me choose to stay off medications. Many of them saw my context switching
to be charming or even a rare skill that helped me succeed. I had newfound resolve in my identity, but 
the looming unstructured problems remained.

## Conquering the Unstructured

You may have noticed a pattern in the spider analogies so far. All the coping mechanisms amount to
adding structure to a problem that isn't inherrently there. The spider turned the two way tunnel into a one 
way tunnel and the golf course into a funnel. The solution to the unstructured problems is always to invent 
structure where it does not exists. If there is no wall to cast strings to, then build the wall!

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="/images/blogposts/feed_me/wall.jpg" alt="Spider building a wall!" class="code-screenshot"  style="transform: rotate(-90deg)">
SPIDER BUILDING A WALL FOR HIS WEBS
</div>

The go to tool for this is the TODO list. A simple list of tasks that takes a nebulous pile of activities
and puts them together. It is the bedrock of structure, but it can often not be enough to help downselect
what I should be doing right now. We can add more with deadlines and priority levels, making it much
easier to pick out immediate needs or very important things. This is where most TODO lists stop, but our
unstructured tasks can easily weasel through. Things like calling a plumber for a harmless droopy faucet,
calling my grandma, and of course booking my yearly checkup can slide right through all three filters.

The solution to this is so simple in hindsight, but when it came to me I was struck. If instead of being
presented a list I was given a single task, I could impose even more structure. If I made sure
that unstructured problems were as likely to be served as structured ones, I could rely on all my other
coping mechanisms for accomplishing a TODO list to brute force them!

```
> feed_me
Usage: feed_me [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  feed_me is a program that provides a simple CLI interface for task
  management. It's goal is to provide the user with a small subset of tasks to
  focus on from their list. This is to protect users from the perils of task
  selection.

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  add       Adds a task to the task_master.
  complete  Marks a task at the given task index as complete.
  serve     Serves tasks based on the current time.
```
<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

`feed_me` is the simple TODO list application I built with my partner Maria to test that hypothesis.
It serves the user a small subset of tasks from their list in a defined order corresponding individual task scores.
The task score monotonically increases in time starting from a user assigned start time, with higher priority
tasks rising up faster. When a task is overdue, its score increases exponentially to ensure it bubbles above
the scores of non-overdue tasks. A user chooses how many tasks they are fed at a time, but the default
is just a single task! It is built by someone with ADHD as as an effective trap for unstructured problems.

depicted here score clamping.
</div>

It is intentionally difficult to edit tasks, meaning that the order of execution of is determined when tasks
are created. As much imagined structure is built in and my coping mechanisms latch onto it
easily. As silly as this tool is, it has legitimately helped me accomplish tasks I was unable to before. 
Before I wrote the core of it, I had a task list that was dozens of items long. These days, that list is 
always about 3 entries long. I hope to keep it that way!

```
